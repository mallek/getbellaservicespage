                            "I am writing this letter today with many thanks to Bella Restoration. When my husband and I returned from vacation, we walked in to find that our water line on our swamp cooler was broken. It had spilled water all over our laminate flooring in our kitchen. I walked into my insurance agent's office to find out what I needed to do about this. He handed me a card for Bella Restoration. As I was talking with my agent I had noticed that their card said they were not only a restoration company but a full service reconstruction team. That was fabulous."

                            "We hired the professionals from Bella Restoration in October 2010 to replace our kitchen floor, which had been destroyed due to flooding caused by a dishwasher malfunction. Of course, the flooding occurred on a weekend so we knew that finding someone to fix not only the leaking issue but the floor was going to be a challenge. We were pleasantly surprised."
